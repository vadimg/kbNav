<h2 class="question">What is it?</h2>
<p class="answer">kbNav can easily make any website completely navigable by keyboard in an intuitive and user-friendly way.

<h2 class="question">A new way to think about shortcuts</h2>
<p class="answer">The way shortcuts are currently implemented in web apps sucks:</p>
<ul class="problems">
    <li><strong>Discoverability.</strong> In a typical web app, shortcuts are invisible. The only way to discover them is to find them in the documentation, which no one will ever do.</li>
    <li><strong>Learnability.</strong> Assuming you discover a list of shortcuts somewhere, you'll still have to memorize them before you can use them. Most people won't bother.</li>
    <li><strong>Usability.</strong> Holding down a combination of Ctrl, Alt, and Shift while pressing another key is awkward and slow.</li>
    <li><strong>Completeness.</strong> The number of shortcuts is limited by the number of keys on a keyboard. For certain actions there's no shortcut and you are forced to use the mouse, which slows you down.</li>
</ul>
<p class="answer">In contrast, kbNav shortcuts appear on the objects you're clicking. You can easily find the shortcut you need.
You'll develop an unconscious association between the shortcut and the action while using the site, eliminating the need for memorization.
kbNav shortcuts are activated simply by pressing keys and then hitting enter. Shortcuts can consist of multiple letters/numbers, so every action can have a shortcut.</p>
</p>

<h2 class="question">Why would you <em>want</em> to use your keyboard?</h2>
<p class="answer"><strong>Mouse navigation is really slow.</strong> Especially if you're using a trackpad. If you are using an application frequently, mouse-only navigation will slow you down. If you have to switch between keyboard and mouse frequently, mouse-only navigation will really slow you down.</p></p>
<p class="answer">kbNav lets you use your keyboard for all operations that were previously mouse-only. Whenever your hands are on the keyboard, kbNav will speed up navigation.</p>


<h2 class="question">Try it out!</h2>
<p class="answer">This website is kbNav'd. You can navigate to any part of it with your keyboard. For example, to go to the documentation, type "d", then hit enter.</p>

<h2 class="question">Who should use this?</h2>
<p class="answer">Some examples uses:
<ul class="examples">
    <li>Email</li>
    <li>Search (especially if there are multiple text inputs to search by)</li>
    <li>Calendar/TODO list/Appointments</li>
    <li>Bug tracker</li>
    <li>Data entry</li>
</ul>
Not <em>every</em> site should be kbNavable. It is most useful for web applications which require switching between typing and navigation. Keeping the user's hands on the keyboard with kbNav would greatly speed them up. This site shouldn't be kbNav'd, it's was done only for demonstration purposes.
